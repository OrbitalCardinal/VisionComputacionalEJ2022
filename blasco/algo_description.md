# Peer Group Filtering for Noise removal Algorithm

The method is divided into a noise detection step and a noise filtering step.

## Noise detection step

The noise detection step is performed in two phases.

### Disjoint blocks phase
In the first phase, the image is partitioned into disjoint blocks.
